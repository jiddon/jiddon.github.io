I am an applied physicist working on the ATLAS experiment at CERN. I have over 7 years experience in the 
research, development, construction, system testing, commissioning and operations of silicon pixel tracking detectors within high energy physics.
I currently work on the operations and data acquisition software development of the ATLAS Pixel detector, the innermost tracking detector
of ATLAS. From October 2023 until October 2024 I was the Pixel run coordinator, which means I was the primary person responsible for ensuring that the Pixel detector is taking high quality data during the 24/7 running schedule of the LHC. The role involved being on-call 24/7 to solve technical problems, driving the operational planning of the Pixel detector and group, as well as representing the Pixel detector within the wider ATLAS operations community. The Pixel detector has been installed since the beginning of the LHC, and is due to  be replaced during the third LHC long shutdown. Maintaining the uptake of quality data, and ensuring the 
safety of the detector, are challenging tasks when considering that the Pixel detector is operating in conditions up to a factor
three more intense than for which it was designed. In addition, the effects of radiation damage become more apparent.
More details can be found [here]({{base_path}}/publication/operational-experience-and-performance-with-the-ATLAS-Pixel-detector).

Before working on ATLAS, I worked on the inner tracking system upgrade for ALICE, ITS2, a silicon monolithic active pixel sensor 
tracking detector with nearly thirteen billion readout channels, the largest and most granular silicon tracker ever buillt.
I was involved in the project throughout the construction and commissioning, writing the system tests and collecting the first real data, 
which I used to make the first measure of the detection efficiency. My thesis can be found [here](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2826537?ln=en).
