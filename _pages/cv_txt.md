Professional Experience

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mar 2025 - present

    Applied Physicist (Staff)
    CERN - Geneva, CH

    -   Applied Physicist for ATLAS ITk Pixel, the largest silicon
        tracking system ever designed.
    -   Focused primarily on the verification and validation of
        chip-level properties within the constructed system during the
        integration of the Outer Barrel of ITk Pixel

Jul 2022 - Feb 2025

    Applied Physicist (Senior Applied Fellow)
    CERN - Geneva, CH

    -   Coordinated operations for the ATLAS silicon Pixel detector,
        ensuring maximum up-time and detector safety to support 24/7 LHC
        data acquisition.
    -   Developed and maintained data acquisition software (C++ /
        Python) with CI testing.
    -   Designed and implemented a software package to improve DAQ
        software flexibility.
    -   Management and training of 24/7 shift crew • On-call detector
        expert • Organisation of weekly meetings • Representation of the
        group in daily ATLAS meetings.
    -   Pixel Run Coordinator (Oct 2023 - Oct 2024) during the hadronic
        collider record breaking year of 2024, and deputy for the six
        months prior.

Oct 2017 - Jul 2022

    Doctoral Researcher
    University of Liverpool / CERN

    -   Constructed, commissioned, and took performance measurements of
        the ALICE Inner Tracking System Upgrade, the largest Monolithic
        Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) tracking detector ever built.
    -   Developed system verification software (Python) for the fully
        integrated tracking system at CERN, verifying the performance of
        13 billion channels.
    -   Achieved a 98% yield in constructing and testing novel CMOS MAPS
        detector modules and staves in clean rooms at the University of
        Liverpool and Daresbury Laboratory.
    -   Conducted the first measurement of detection efficiency using 5
        million cosmic muon tracks, confirming system capabilities.
